TPS 2

1. How can you open a terminal from your Linux/Mac/Windows computer?
I am using Windows 11 on my laptop and Windows 10 on my personal computer. For both devices I can open a terminal
simply by opening either the "Terminal", "Command Prompt", or "Powershell" programs.

a. Can you open more than 1 terminal at the same time?
Yes, I can have multiple terminals open and running simultaneously.

b. Why do you think you want to open more than 1 terminal at the same time?
I may want more than 1 terminal open at the same time because having multiple terminals open allows me to have access
to multiple directories on my device at the same time which can say a lot of time switching between directories especially
when while working on complicated projects. I may also want certain terminals running tasks that take a while to process
so having multiple terminals frees me from any bottlenecks in productivity that may cause.

2. In the terminal, how can you tell what are contents inside the current directory (i.e., what is the command)?
"ls"

3. From your current directory, how can you navigate to Desktop directory?
"cd ~"
"cd Desktop"

4. While you are in Desktop, create a new directory called CSE31. How do you do this?
"mkdir CSE31"

You will refer to these references to answer the following questions.
3. What command do you type in the terminal to compile your main.c?
"gcc main.c"

4. How do you know if your program has compiled successfully?
For Windows a new "a.exe" program should be generated.

5. What does the –c flag do in gcc?
Using -c compiles the c file into an .o object file.

6. What does the –g flag do in gcc?
Using -g generates additional symbolic debugging information for use with the gdb debugger. 

7. How do you change the executable name from main to cselab1?
Use the "-o" flag and specify the name "cselab1.exe" while compiling main.c

8. What happens when you compile your code by typing gcc main.c only?
The resulting executable program will be called "a".

9. Now, let us run the program you have just compiled. What command do you use?
"a" (Windows)
"./a" (Linux)
