1. What is the full name of the processor you selected?
===
Intel Core i5 i5-6500

2. How many levels of caches does your CPU have (L1, L2, L3, etc.)? Is there a separate L1 cache for data 
and instructions?
===
This CPU has 3 levels of cache: L1, L2, L3.
This is a separate L1 cache for data and instructions.

3. How big is each level of cache?
===
L1 data: 4 x 32 KB
L1 instructions: 4 x 32 KB
L2: 4 x 256 KB
L3: 6 MB

4. What is the block size (sometimes it is called line size)?
===
The block (line) size of every level of cache is 64 bytes.

5. Are the caches direct-mapped or set associative? If set associative, how many ways?
===
The caches are set associative.
L1 data: 8-way
L1 instructions: 8-way
L2: 4-way
L3: 12-way

6. With L1 data cache, how many tag bits, index bits, and offset bits?
===
tag bits: 8-way set requires 3 bits
index bits: 128000B / 512B = 250, cache addresses requires 8 bits
offset bits: 64 bytes (64 data columns) requires 6 bits
