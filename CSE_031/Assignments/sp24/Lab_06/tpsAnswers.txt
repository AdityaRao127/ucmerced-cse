TPS 1

1. Once fib.s is assembled, open the Execute tab (it should be opened by default after assembled). Two 
segments of memory are displayed here: Text Segment and Data Segment. What are the starting 
addresses of Text Segment and Data Segment? Give your answers in Hex format.  
---
The starting address of the Text Segment is 0x00400000
The starting adderss of the Data Segment is 0x10010000


2. The Text Segment shows you how each actual machine code is stored in the memory (again it is 
simulated) and its corresponding MIPS code. Two types of MIPS code are shown here: Basic and Source. 
We call the Basic one True Assembly Language, and the Source one MIPS Assembly Language. 
From the display, what can you tell about the difference between the two in terms of their relationship 
with the machine code? We will cover this topic in future lectures.
---
Both Basic and Source MIPS code point are represented by the same machine code. This suggests that the two
variations are exactly equivalent.


3. Now, let us take a look at the Data Segment. How much difference in bytes are there between 2 address 
locations (again, the addresses are in Hex)?
---
The difference between 2 address locations in the Data Segment is 4 bytes.


4. For each address location, how many columns are there?
---
There are 8 columns for each address location each equally spaced 4 bits apart.


5. What can you tell about the relationship between the address difference and the number of columns at 
each address location?
---
The number of columns directly affects the space between each column (their address difference). Since a 32-bit
address stores 8 columns, each column is spaced 4 bits apart.


6. From the source code, how do you create a new variable/label named m and set it to 20?
---
To create a new variable named m set to 20, placed the code "m: .word 20" underneath the .data section. 


7. Save and assemble your file. At what address is the value of m stored?
---
0x10010004. The value of m is stored in the 2nd column of the first address in the Data Segment. Since the base address
is 0x10010000, adding 4 bits to this address results in the address 0x10010004.


8. Besides numbers, we can also initialize strings for the program to use. Search from the Internet on how 
to declare a string named str1 and set it to “I love CSE31!”
---



9. Insert the declaration of str1 in your code and assemble it. From the Data Segment, we can see that 
the string is occupying 3 address locations. At what addresses is str1 stored?
---


10. str1 is stored as numerical values in the memory. Check the ASCII box and observe how it is stored. 
Does the display of characters agree with what you have learned from Lab 04 about how an array of 
characters is stored?
---


11. In order to print str1, we will need to use syscall function. Search the Internet to find out how to 
print str1.
---


12. Now let us go back to the program. Search from the Internet to find out what “la $t3, n” does. 
What will be the value stored in $t3 after running this instruction? From this we can see that we cannot 
use the initialized variables (labels) directly in our MIPS program. We need to use la, then lw to save 
the value into a register
