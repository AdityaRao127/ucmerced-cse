TPS 1

1. Load fib.s in MARS and study the code. This is the same program we worked on during Lab 06.
---
This fibonacci program initializes the number 13 which loops the fib function 13 times.

2. Recall that fib.s calculates the 13th Fibonacci number (n = 13). Now let us make this program more 
generic so it will calculate the nth Fibonacci number, where n can be any number from a user input.
---
# Get user input
li $v0, 5
syscall
move $t3, $v0

3. From Lab 06, we have learned how to print out statements in MIPS. Insert instructions in fib.s so 
that the program will print out “Please enter a number: ” at the beginning of the program to 
prompt user for input.
---
inputPrompt:	.asciiz "Please enter a number: "
# Load prompt into $a0
la $a0, inputPrompt	
# Print prompt in $a0
li $v0, 4
syscall

4. In the program, $t3 was used to store the value of n. Now, let us read in a user input and save that 
value into $t3. Do a search in the MARS documentations to find out how to use syscall to read an 
INTEGER from a user. Again, you must store the value into $t3.
---
# Get user input
li $v0, 5
syscall
move $t3, $v0

5. Since the program now reads a number from a user, do we need to declare n in the .data segment of 
the program? How about the la and lw instructions regarding n? Comment out those instructions so 
they will not mess up your program.
---
No we do not need them anymore.

6. Assemble the program and test it with different numbers to see if it runs correctly (you may use the 
original fib.s to verify your results.). 
---
My new program works correctly.


TPS 2

1. Study recursion.c and trace the program. Without running the program, what will be the output if 5 
is entered? Compile and run recursion.c in a terminal (or any IDE) and verify your answer.
---
I think that this program will output "4" along with the other print messages if 5 is entered.
I was wrong, the correct output is 29.

2. Load recursion.s in MARS. This is the MIPS version of recursion.c. Do not assemble and run 
this program – the program is incomplete. Study the main function and discuss with your partner(s) 
about what it does (compare it with the C version). A lot of instructions are missing, and we will fill 
them out in the following steps. 
---
recursion.s currently has a main function that prepares space for an input argument from the user and jumps
to the recursion function. It does not ask for any input or initialize any values.

3. Since the recursion.c prompts to a user for input, insert instructions in recursion.s so the 
program will prompt the same statement to a user.
---
inputPrompt:	.asciiz "Please enter an integer: "
# Load prompt into $a0
la $a0, inputPrompt	
# Print prompt in $a0
li $v0, 4
syscall

4. Insert statements for the program to read in a value from a user. What register should we use to store 
that value? (Hint: you will use it as the argument for your recursion function call.)
---
I will store the user input in register $a0
# Get user input
li $v0, 5
syscall
move $a0, $v0

5. Next, the main function calls recursion with the correct input argument. After returning from 
recursion, we need to print out the returned value. What register do we expect the returned value to 
be stored in? However, the syscall for printing out a value is also using the same register. What can 
we do?
---
We expect the return value to be stored in register $v0. Since $v0 is also used for syscall commands,
we can first store the return value in $v0 into register $a0 and then store the print command in $v0.
This is also convienent since the value in $a0 will be printed out anyways.

6. Based on your answer from step 5, insert the correct instructions to print out the returned value before 
jumping to the end of program.
---
addu $a0, $zero, $v0
li $v0, 1		 
syscall

7. Now, let us complete the recursion function. The stack pointer was moved to create extra storage 
for the function. How many integer values are reserved in this storage? What is the first thing to be 
stored in this stack frame? Insert a statement to accomplish this.
---


8. Based on the branch statement under label recursion, update the returning value. Again, you must 
use the correct register to store the returning value.
---


9. Based on the branch statement under label not_minus_one, update the returning value. Again, you 
must use the correct register to store the returning value.
---


10. When the input argument is not 0 or -1, the program will call recursion 2 times. This happens in the 
code under label not_zero. Why do we need to save $a0 into the stack?
---


11. Insert a statement to update the input argument for the next recursion call.
---


12. After returning from the last recursion, the program is about to call the next recursion. However, 
the last recursion came back with a returned value. What will happen to if we call recursion right 
away? Insert statements to prevent this from happening.
---


13. Now the program is ready to call recursion again. Insert statements to update the next input 
argument.
---


14. After returning from the second recursion call, insert statements to update the final value to be 
returned to main.
---


15. Before returning to main, a value needs to be retrieved so the program can return to the correct 
location of the code. What is this value? Insert a statement under the label end_recur to retrieve this 
value
