# Computer Science and Engineering Curriculum at University of California, Merced
===

## [CSE 022: Introduction to Programming](https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=20&coid=50100)
#### *Fall 2022*

Introduces students to programming, computational thinking, and problem solving concepts, teaching students how to use computers as tools rather than appliances. In addition to programming skills, students also learn industry-standard practices, such as version control, unit testing and debugging. Follows a Project-Based Learning Philosophy, with Python as the main programming language, ~~but students also get exposure to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL~~.

## [CSE 024: Advanced Programming](https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=20&coid=50104)
#### *Spring 2023*

Intended for students with basic to intermediate programming skills, and introduces them to advanced programming techniques such as pointers and memory management, exception handling, multi-threading, object oriented programming, and generic programming. The C++ language is used throughout the course.

## [CSE 030: Data Structures](https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=16&coid=39178)
#### *Fall 2023*

Focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of fundamental data structures, design patterns, and algorithms used throughout computer science, including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, recursion, and methods for searching and sorting.

## [CSE 031: Computer Organization and Assembly Language](https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=16&coid=39179)
#### *Spring 2024*

Exposes students to the underlying structure of machines. Starting from C programming, pointers, data representation, MIPS instruction-set, Compilation process and down to Hardware implementation.

---

## [CSE 100: Algorithm Design and Analysis](https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=16&coid=39183)
#### *Spring 2024*
Introduction to the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Topics will include concepts of algorithm complexity, and various algorithmic design patterns like divide and conquer, dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. Also covers major algorithms and data structures for searching and sorting, graphs and some optimization techniques.
